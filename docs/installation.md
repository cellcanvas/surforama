# Installing surforama

`Surforama` is a python package that can be installed via PyPI. If you are just getting started, we recommend installing Surforama via an environment manager such as `venv` or `mamba`. We recommend Python 3.9 or greater. Once you have set up your Python environment, you can install `Surforama` with the following commands.

`surforama` requires the napari viewer. If you would like to install napari and surforama together in one line, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install "surforama[napari]"
```

If you already have napari installed, you can directly install surforama in the same environment:

```bash
pip install surforama
```

After installation completes, you can test the installation using our [Getting Started](getting_started.md) tutorial. If you have questions you can post on the CellCanvas stream of the [image.sc zulip chat](http://imagesc.zulipchat.com/).
